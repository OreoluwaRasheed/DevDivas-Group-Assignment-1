        <p> When your mother asks, Do you want a piece of advice? it is a mere formality. It doesn’t matter if you answer yes or no. You’re going to get it anyway. —Erma Bombeck 
            <hr>

            I saw a study that said speaking in front of a crowd is considered the number one fear of the average person. Number two was death. This means to the average person, if you have to be at a funeral, you would rather be in the casket than doing the eulogy. —Jerry Seinfeld

            If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. – Sam Redwine 
            <hr>

            I don't believe that if you do good, good things will happen. Everything is completely accidental and random. Sometimes bad things happen to very good people and sometimes good things happen to bad people. But at least if you try to do good things, then you're spending your time doing something worthwhile. Helen Mirren

            If you define evolution as merely meaning change over time, then I don't see any problem with a person being a Christian and believing in evolution. But that's not how textbooks define evolution. They define evolution as being random and undirected without plan or purpose. Lee Strobel
